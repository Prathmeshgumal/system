# Notes — Concepts to Revisit

Important concepts that come up while we design and build. Each note is short enough to
re-read in 5 minutes, with pointers for going deeper in your free time.

## 1. Same-origin policy, CORS & reverse proxies

*Came up in Part 0.1 — how the React app reaches the Go API.*

### What it is

**Origin** = scheme + host + port. All three must match for two URLs to be the same origin:

| URL A | URL B | Same origin? |
|---|---|---|
| `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:8080` | ❌ port differs |
| `https://relay.com` | `http://relay.com` | ❌ scheme differs |
| `https://app.relay.com` | `https://api.relay.com` | ❌ host differs |
| `https://relay.com/a` | `https://relay.com/b` | ✅ path doesn't matter |

**Same-origin policy (SOP):** the browser's core security rule. JavaScript on one origin
can't *read* responses from another origin. Without it, any website you visit could
call `fetch("https://yourbank.com/account")` — with your bank cookies attached — and read your data.

Subtle point: SOP mostly blocks **reading the response**, not **sending the request**.
A simple cross-origin POST still reaches the server; JS just can't see the reply.
That's why CSRF attacks exist (Part 1.1).

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** the server's way of saying "I allow these
other origins to read my responses", using response headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.relay.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true        # allow cookies
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Max-Age: 600                   # cache the preflight for 10 min
```

**Preflight:** for "non-simple" requests (JSON body, `Authorization` header, `PATCH`/`DELETE`…)
the browser first sends an `OPTIONS` request asking permission, and only sends the real
request if the answer is yes. That's an extra round trip (unless cached via `Max-Age`).

**Reverse proxy:** a server that sits in front of your app servers and forwards requests
to them. The client only sees the proxy. (A *forward* proxy is the opposite: it sits in
front of *clients*, like a corporate proxy.) Reverse proxies also do TLS, compression,
caching, load balancing — Nginx, Caddy, HAProxy, Envoy, AWS ALB are all reverse proxies.

### Why it matters for us

- The proxy makes React and the API **one origin**, so SOP never gets in the way —
  the proxy → Go hop is server-to-server, and browser rules don't apply there.
- Cookies stay simple: our refresh-token cookie (Part 1.1) is first-party.
- The same proxy will later become our **load balancer** (Phase 3) — one concept, growing.

### What we chose

**Same origin via reverse proxy** (Part 0.1, decision C):

| Mode | Proxy | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| dev | Vite dev server | `/` → React (hot reload), `/api/*` + `/ws` → `localhost:8080` |
| full / prod | Caddy container | `/` → built React files, `/api/*` + `/ws` → `api:8080` |

WebSockets need the proxy to pass through the HTTP `Upgrade` handshake — Vite needs
`ws: true` in its proxy config; Caddy does it automatically.

### Gotchas

- **CORS is not server security.** It only restrains browsers. `curl` or a script ignores
  it completely, so never rely on CORS to protect an API — that's what auth is for.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` **cannot** be combined with credentials (cookies).
  You must echo a specific allowed origin.
- **Same-site ≠ same-origin.** `app.relay.com` and `api.relay.com` are *cross-origin* but
  *same-site* (same registrable domain `relay.com`), so `SameSite=Lax` cookies still flow
  between them. Truly different sites (`relay.com` ↔ `relay-api.io`) need `SameSite=None; Secure`.
- A proxy hides the real client IP — the app must read `X-Forwarded-For` (and only trust
  it from the proxy). Matters for rate limiting in Phase 3.

### Go deeper

- MDN: *Same-origin policy* and *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)* — the definitive reference
- Open DevTools → Network on any big site, find an `OPTIONS` request, read its headers
- Try it in Part 0.1: temporarily call `http://localhost:8080/api/health` directly from
  React, watch the CORS error in the console, then see the proxy fix it
- web.dev: *SameSite cookies explained*

### Interview angle

- "Why does my fetch work in Postman but fail in the browser?" → SOP/CORS, Postman isn't a browser.
- "What does a reverse proxy / API gateway do in your architecture?" → TLS termination,
  routing, load balancing, rate limiting, hiding internal services.
- "How would you serve web + mobile clients?" → mobile apps aren't bound by SOP; a public
  API for third parties would need CORS (or a separate API domain).
